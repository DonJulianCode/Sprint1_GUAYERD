# üß† Copilot Prompts Log ‚Äì Excel Sales Analysis System

This document compiles the main prompts provided to GitHub Copilot during the development of the **Excel Sales Analysis System**.  
The goal of these prompts was to automate data merging, visualization, and report generation using Python.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project aims to:

- Merge multiple Excel files into a unified master dataset.  
- Analyze sales performance by products, clients, and months.  
- Provide a console-based interactive menu for quick exploration.  
- Display results elegantly using the `tabulate` library.  
- Visualize data relationships between Excel files through network diagrams.  

All tasks are designed to run seamlessly in **Google Colab** or **VSCode**.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Merge and Menu System
```text
Create a Python program that:
1. Reads several Excel files from URLs or local paths.
2. Merges them into a master dataset.
3. Displays a text-based menu with options like:
   - Show best-selling products (by quantity and by total sales).
   - Identify top customers.
   - Analyze monthly sales.
Use `tabulate` with "fancy_grid" style to display results nicely.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Add Option for Top Products
Add option 7 to the previous menu:
   - Show top-selling products both by quantity and total revenue.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Markdown Summary Report
Generate a Markdown summary report with:
   - Key metrics (sales, customers, months).
   - Highlighted top performers.
   - A short insight paragraph per section.
Output should be pure Markdown, ready to copy-paste.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Excel Relationship Diagram
Create a diagram that shows how the Excel files relate to each other based on shared columns.
Each file is a node; draw connecting edges where columns overlap.
Use `networkx` and `matplotlib` to visualize the relationships.

5Ô∏è‚É£ Schema Visualization (Mock Version)
Even without real Excel files, generate a mock relationship diagram that represents:
   - ventas_enero.xlsx
   - ventas_febrero.xlsx
   - clientes.xlsx
   - productos.xlsx
Assume shared keys like `id_producto` and `id_cliente`.
Label nodes and edges to simulate the schema visually.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Unified Aesthetic Output
Ensure all charts, tables, and menus are clean and formatted.
Keep everything within one Python script for easy execution in Colab or VSCode.

üßÆ Tools and Libraries

pandas ‚Üí Excel reading and merging
tabulate ‚Üí Table formatting
networkx + matplotlib ‚Üí Graph-based relationship diagrams
os ‚Üí File handling
collections / itertools ‚Üí Data aggregation

üí° Outcome

The resulting system provides:

An elegant, menu-driven interface for exploring sales data.
Automatically generated Markdown summaries for reporting.
Visual diagrams that clarify relationships among Excel sources.
A portable, well-documented Python script ready for real datasets.
